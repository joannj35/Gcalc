# Gcalc
Introduction to Systems Programming final project (implemented in Winter 2019-2020)

Graph Calculator:

In this project i had to exercise a calculator where the variables in the calculator are tuned graphs.
The calculator has two modes:
  - Interactive mode in which commands are read from stdin and output is written to stdout
  - automatic mode (batch) in which I/O is performed from/to txt files, either in "binary form" or normal text files.
    - the calculator can decode a binary input file
